# Before you begin, make sure you have the latest versions of setuptools and wheel:

# python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
# To build a setuptools project, run this command from the same directory where setup.py is located:

# python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
# This will generate distribution archives in the dist directory.

# Before you upload the generated archives make sure youâ€™re registered on https://test.pypi.org/account/register/. You will also need to verify your email to be able to upload any packages. You should install twine to be able to upload packages:

# python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
# Now, to upload these archives, run:

# twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
# To install your newly uploaded package example_pkg, you can use pip:

# python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ example_pkg
# If you have issues at any point, please refer to Packaging project tutorials for clarification.
